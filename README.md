1.In general Computers use their IP addresses to connect with each other.For humans it's hard to remember those IP addresses .Hence we are going for DNS. 
A DNS service that translates human readable names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. 2.The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. 
Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
